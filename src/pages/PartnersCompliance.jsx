          <p className="lead">
            KTECH works with a network of international suppliers and buyers. We do not
            disclose partner names or references publicly. Supplier and client references
            are shared only after mutual agreement and in accordance with confidentiality
            arrangements. This protects all parties and maintains the discretion that
            institutional counterparties expect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our network is built on verified mandates, qualified offtake, and a shared
            commitment to compliant, professional conduct. We continuously ensure that our
            processes align with international trading practice and the expectations of
            financial institutions and compliance teams.

          <h2>NCNDA Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Where appropriate, transactions are conducted under Non-Circumvention,
            Non-Disclosure Agreements (NCNDA). These agreements protect the identity and
            commercial interests of buyers, sellers, and intermediaries throughout the
            process. KTECH supports the use of NCNDA and related frameworks as part of
            standard international energy trading practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not disclose counterparty information without consent. All introductions
            and communications are handled with controlled access and in line with the
            confidentiality obligations we undertake.
